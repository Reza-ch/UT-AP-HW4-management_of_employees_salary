# Employee Salary Management System

This repository contains the solution to Homework 4 of the Advanced Programming course at the University of Tehran. The task was to implement a program in C++ to manage and calculate employee salaries based on input data, applying various object-oriented programming principles and practices.

## Overview

The program processes employee data, performs salary calculations, and generates an output file containing the results. The main goal of this homework was to demonstrate the use of object-oriented concepts such as classes.

## Project Details

1. **Input File**:  
   - The program reads employee information from an `input.txt` file.  
   - The data includes details such as employee names, IDs, base salaries, and additional benefits or deductions.

2. **Object-Oriented Design**:  
   - Employees are represented as objects of a class.  
   - Class methods are used to handle various operations such as reading input data, calculating salaries, and writing the output.  

3. **Salary Calculation**:  
   - For each employee, the base salary is modified by adding benefits and subtracting deductions to calculate the final salary.  
   - This logic is implemented within the class methods.

4. **Output File**:  
   - The results, including each employee's details and computed salary, are written to `output.txt`.  
   - The output is formatted for clarity and correctness.


This project showcases the application of object-oriented programming techniques to a practical problem, fulfilling the requirements of the Advanced Programming course homework.
